# WebDevServVer README
I wrote this script(s) as a developer so that I would know which version of
Apache,PHP,MariaDB,MySQL,phpMyAdmin I had installed and if there was a newer version.

I use a version of USBWebserver that I have updated to latest Apache,PHP,
MariaDB,phpMyAdmin while still keeping it portable.

- USBWebserver     : http://www.usbwebserver.net/webserver/
- Apache (Windows) : http://www.apachelounge.com/download/
- Apache (Linux)   : https://httpd.apache.org/
- PHP (Windows)    : http://windows.php.net
- PHP (Linux)      : https://www.php.net/
- MariaDB (Windows/Linux): https://downloads.mariadb.org
- MySQL (Windows/Linux)  : http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

1. Edit "./WebDevServVer/WebDevServVer_settings.php" file for you setup.
2. Add the following to the top of page you want to display the Server information.

	include ("./WebDevServVer/WebDevServVer_index.php");"

3. For latest Server Version variables, there is a class CSS that will need to be 
added to your css to define the link colors (Default: red or #ff0000):
```
	.USBWSVerNew {color:#ff0000;}
	a.USBWSVerNew:link {color:#ff0000;}
	a.USBWSVerNew:visited {color:#ff0000;}
	a.USBWSVerNew:active {color:#ff0000;}
	a.USBWSVerNew:hover {color:#ff0000;}
```
4. See the list below of server information variables.
NOTE: These variables could change overtime as updates are made to script(s), 
if you get any error about variable could not be found, check the list again.
Example(s):
	<?php echo $installed_apache; ?>
	<?php echo $latest_apache; ?>

Below are the variables with the installed and latest version for each server and add-on scripting language (Version # for Linux come from Version # collected for Windows; Linux version will be close to the Windows Version #).
